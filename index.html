				<i>The Flash</i> is one example of a show that was inspired by a popular comic book. It does a great job in following the comics general plot without straying too far off of the original comic storyline. Another Example of a comic book adaptation would have to be the <i>Avengers</i>.

				<h3>Avengers and Marvels take on the live action versions</h3>
			</header>
			<p>
				The <i>Avengers</i> films are great films, but they do not follow the comics strictly. The story does have the basis of the stories that are in the comics, but they have thier own unique verson of the stories. Even though it is not exactly like the comic books, it is still a very entertaining to watch. The Live-action adaptations of Comic books really are advancing.
